**Project Description**

One should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then one should use spreadsheets 
or another Excel-like software to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
This project is open-ended in that there is not one right answer.


**Understanding the Data - How the Data Were Collected**

It is common practice in marketing to send surveys to learn about your audience, and build a product that best meets their needs. 
The survey that this project is based of off was sent to just do that for Udacity to learn about the students across many of their 
programs!
